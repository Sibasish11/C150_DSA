# Compare and contrast Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notations in the context of an algorithm's running time. (Conceptual, in comments).

```c

1) Big O Notation (O):
   - Definition: Describes the *upper bound* of an algorithm's running time.
   - Meaning: The algorithm will run *at most* this fast (worst-case scenario).
   - Example: If T(N) = 3N^2 + 5N + 2, then T(N) = O(N^2).
   - Usage: Helps estimate the worst-case performance.

2) Big Omega Notation (Ω):
   - Definition: Describes the *lower bound* of an algorithm's running time.
   - Meaning: The algorithm will run *at least* this fast (best-case scenario).
   - Example: If T(N) = 3N^2 + 5N + 2, then T(N) = Ω(N^2).
   - Usage: Shows the guaranteed minimum time complexity.

3) Big Theta Notation (Θ):
   - Definition: Describes the *tight bound* of an algorithm's running time.
   - Meaning: The algorithm runs asymptotically *exactly* at this rate
     (both upper and lower bounds are the same).
   - Example: If T(N) = 3N^2 + 5N + 2, then T(N) = Θ(N^2).
   - Usage: Provides the most accurate asymptotic characterization.

Comparison:

- Big O   → Worst-case growth rate (upper bound).
- Big Ω   → Best-case growth rate (lower bound).
- Big Θ   → Average/Exact asymptotic growth (tight bound, both O and Ω).

Analogy:

Think of running a race:
- Big O: The *maximum time* it could take you to finish.
- Big Ω: The *minimum time* it could take you to finish.
- Big Θ: The *typical/exact time* it generally takes you to finish
         (when both bounds match).

Final Note:

In practice, Big O is most commonly used to describe algorithm efficiency,
but Θ gives the most precise asymptotic behavior.
