# Write a program to find the largest prime factor of a given number N. Analyze its time complexity.

## Program: Largest Prime Factor of a Given Number N

This program finds the largest prime factor of a given number N
using trial division method.

Algorithm:
- Divide out all factors of 2 (if present).
- Then check odd factors from 3 up to sqrt(N).
- Whenever we find a factor, divide it out completely.
- If N > 2 at the end, then N itself is a prime factor (and the largest).

### Time Complexity Analysis:

- We only check divisors up to sqrt(N).
- Each division reduces N, so it becomes smaller as we progress.
- Worst case: N is prime, so we check all odd numbers up to sqrt(N).

#### Therefore:
ðŸ‘‰ Time Complexity = O(âˆšN)
ðŸ‘‰ Space Complexity = O(1)

Example:

Input: 13195
Prime factors = 5, 7, 13, 29
Largest prime factor = 29


```c

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to find the largest prime factor
long long largestPrimeFactor(long long n) {
    long long maxPrime = -1;

    // Step 1: Divide out factors of 2
    while (n % 2 == 0) {
        maxPrime = 2;
        n /= 2;
    }

    // Step 2: Check odd factors
    for (long long i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
        while (n % i == 0) {
            maxPrime = i;
            n /= i;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: If n > 2, then n itself is prime
    if (n > 2) {
        maxPrime = n;
    }

    return maxPrime;
}

int main() {
    long long n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%lld", &n);

    printf("Largest prime factor of %lld is: %lld\n", n, largestPrimeFactor(n));
    return 0;
}

```
