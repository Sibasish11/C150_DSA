# Write a program to calculate X raised to the power N using repeated multiplication. Analyze its time complexity.

```c

Explanation:

- The goal is to compute X^N (X raised to the power N).
- Approach: Multiply X repeatedly N times.
    Example: X^5 = X * X * X * X * X
- This is a naive method (repeated multiplication).

Algorithm:

1. Input base (X) and exponent (N).
2. Initialize result = 1.
3. Loop from 1 to N:
       result = result * X
4. Print result.

Time Complexity:

- The loop runs N times.
- Each iteration performs one multiplication.
- Therefore, Time Complexity = O(N).
- Space Complexity = O(1) (only a few variables used).

Note:

- This is not efficient for large N.
- An optimized method is "Exponentiation by Squaring" with O(log N) complexity.



#include <stdio.h>


long long power(long long x, int n) {
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result = result * x;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    long long x;
    int n;

    printf("Enter base (X): ");
    scanf("%lld", &x);
    printf("Enter exponent (N): ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("%lld^%d = %lld\n", x, n, power(x, n));

    return 0;
}


```

## Example Runs

```c
Enter base (X): 2
Enter exponent (N): 5
2^5 = 32

Enter base (X): 3
Enter exponent (N): 4
3^4 = 81

```
