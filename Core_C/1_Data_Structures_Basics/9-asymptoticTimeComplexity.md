Consider a sorting algorithm that compares every element with every other element.
Describe its asymptotic time complexity (no implementation needed, just conceptual understanding).

Explanation:

- Suppose we have 'n' elements to sort.
- If the algorithm compares every element with every other element:
    - Element 1 is compared with (n - 1) elements.
    - Element 2 is compared with (n - 1) elements.
    - ...
    - Element n is compared with (n - 1) elements.
- Total comparisons = n * (n - 1) â‰ˆ O(n^2).

Asymptotic Time Complexity:

- The number of comparisons grows quadratically with the input size.
- Therefore, the algorithm runs in **O(n^2)** time complexity.

Intuition:

- This behavior is similar to simple sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort 
  and Selection Sort, which also require O(n^2) comparisons in the worst case.
- While O(n^2) sorting algorithms are acceptable for small input sizes,
  they are inefficient for large input sizes compared to more efficient
  algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort that run in O(n log n).


A sorting algorithm that compares every element with every other element has 
an **asymptotic time complexity of O(n^2)**.
