# Write a program to implement a naive primality test for a given number. Analyze and comment on its time complexity.

- A naive primality test checks if a number N is prime by testing divisibility.
- Steps:
    1. If N <= 1, it is not prime.
    2. Check divisibility of N by every integer from 2 to N-1.
    3. If any divisor is found, N is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

Time Complexity:

- We perform (N-2) checks in the worst case (when N is prime).
- Therefore, Time Complexity = O(N).
- Space Complexity = O(1) (only a few variables used).
- Note: This is inefficient for large N compared to optimized tests
  (e.g., checking up to sqrt(N)).



```c

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to check primality (naive method)
int isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 0; // 0 and 1 are not prime

    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return 0; 
        }
    }
    return 1; // No divisors found, prime
}

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (isPrime(n))
        printf("%d is a Prime Number.\n", n);
    else
        printf("%d is NOT a Prime Number.\n", n);

    return 0;
}


```

## âœ… Example Runs:

```c

Enter a number: 7
7 is a Prime Number.

Enter a number: 12
12 is NOT a Prime Number.


```
