# Data Structures and Competitive Coding Practice

Welcome to my GitHub repository for documenting my journey through solving the 150 practice questions from the **Data Structures with Competitive Coding** course. This repository serves as a record of my progress, solutions, and insights as I work through the problems outlined in the course syllabus. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and competitive coding techniques while preparing for software development roles.

## Course Overview

The **Data Structures with Competitive Coding** course focuses on mastering algorithm analysis, dynamic data structures, and efficient problem-solving techniques. The practice set includes 150 problems across various modules, covering fundamental and advanced topics in data structures and algorithms. The course is structured to enhance skills in:

- Algorithm analysis and recursion
- Implementing dynamic data structures (e.g., linked lists, binary trees)
- Applying sub-quadratic sorting and searching algorithms
- Solving coding problems under timed conditions
- Preparing for software development roles

The syllabus is divided into seven modules:
1. **Data Structures Basics** (Complexity analysis, algorithms, pseudocode)
2. **Arrays and Linked Lists** (Array operations, singly/doubly/circular linked lists)
3. **Stacks and Queues** (Stack/queue operations, variants like circular and priority queues)
4. **Trees** (Binary trees, BSTs, AVL, Red-Black trees)
5. **Graphs** (Graph representations, BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms)
6. **Hashing and Heaps** (Hash tables, min/max heaps, collision handling)
7. **Sorting and Searching** (Linear/binary search, bubble, quick, merge, heap sort)

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to reflect the course's modular structure. Each module has its own directory, containing solutions to the corresponding practice questions. The structure is as follows:

```
â”œâ”€â”€1_Data_Structures_Basics/
â”œâ”€â”€2_Arrays_LinkedLists/
â”œâ”€â”€3_Stacks_Queues/
â”œâ”€â”€4_Trees/
â”œâ”€â”€5_Graphs/
â”œâ”€â”€6_Hashing_Heaps/
â”œâ”€â”€7_Sorting_Searching/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ syllabus.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ progress_tracker.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```

- **Module Directories**: Each module folder contains solutions to the practice questions, named according to the problem number and description.
- **docs/**: Contains the course syllabus (`syllabus.md`) and a progress tracker (`progress_tracker.md`) to monitor my completion status.

## Progress Tracking

I will update the `progress_tracker.md` file in the `docs/` directory to reflect my progress. Each problem will be marked as:
- **Optimized**: Solution refined for better performance or readability.


## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse Solutions**: Navigate to the relevant module folder to view solutions for specific problems.
2. **Check Progress**: Refer to `docs/progress_tracker.md` for an overview of completed problems and ongoing work.
3. **Run Code**: Most solutions are written in C. To run a program:
   - Ensure you have a C compiler installed.
   - Compile the code.
   - Run the executable.
4. **Contribute or Suggest**: If you have suggestions for improving solutions or alternative approaches, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Goals

Through this repository, I aim to:
- Solve all 150 practice questions systematically.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of each solution.
- Optimize solutions for efficiency where possible.
- Document key insights and learning outcomes.
- Build a portfolio of competitive coding solutions to showcase my skills.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Primarily C for its performance and widespread use in competitive programming.
- **Tools**: Standard C compiler.
- **Testing**: Manual testing with sample inputs for validation.
